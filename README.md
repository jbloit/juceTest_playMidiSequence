# Load and play a midi file with Juce	

My first attempt at this. Ugly glitches when loading. 
Not sure about coding standards.

Sort of works anyway. Use at your own risk. 

Had to extend last note's off message so that the sequence loops with correct length. Is there a way to get a sequence length longer than the last note's noteOff message?
